## !MyShoes

Jump in and experience our Oculus Google Maps geography guessing game! Using an Oculus Headset and a Myo armband, you'll be given 3 locations in the world sourced from Google Streetview as well as accompanying national anthems. See which capital cities you can identify!

This project is also more than just a game. We believe that by giving an easy and lifelike glimpse into the lives of people around the world we can inspire compassion and understanding. Our name, !MyShoes ("!" indicating "not"), reflects the ability of our technology to literally put you in the shoes of someone else and experience the world from their eyes.
